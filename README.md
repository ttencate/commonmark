CommonMark for Go
=================

[`commonmark`](https://github.com/ttencate/commonmark) aims to be a
standards-compliant, pluggable and fast [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org)
implementation for [Go](http://golang.org) (golang).

It is not ready for use, and probably never will be. As it turns out, writing a CommonMark implementation that (a) conforms to the spec, (b) does not mirror the inextensible, inflexible design of the reference implementation, and (c) is pluggable, is harder than I estimated, and I don't have time for it.

Alternatives
------------

- [sudhirj/godown](https://github.com/sudhirj/godown), at the time of writing
  (Oct 2014), claims to be a "Fast and parallel CommonMark parser" but is as of
  yet incomplete (only 55 lines of code), and doesn't appear to be parallel.
- [valoox/gomk](https://github.com/valoox/gomk), at the time of writing (Oct
  2014), claims to be a "Go implementation of the standard CommonMark markdown
  parser" but contains no code yet.
- There might be a case for wrapping the
  [official C implementation](https://github.com/jgm/CommonMark) in a Go
  library. It will not be pluggable, but it will likely be faster. At the time
  of writing (Oct 2014), no such wrapper exists.
